So this patch series began when I looked at this [issue](https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/issues/1173) in the Rust for Linux project. It looked pretty simple on the surface.

> ‚ÄúJust move these parts (ARef and AlwaysRefCounted) into a new file, clean it up, done.‚Äù

---

#### The Rabbit Hole
I started out by moving the `ARef` and `AlwaysRefCounted` modules to a new files `sync/aref.rs` and removed them from `types.rs`.

```c
diff --git a/rust/kernel/sync/aref.rs b/rust/kernel/sync/aref.rs
new file mode 100644
index 00000000000000..dbd77bb68617ca

and so on..
```
You can have a look at the complete file [here](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/tree/rust/kernel/sync/aref.rs?id=07dad44aa9a93b16af19e8609a10b241c352b440).

Once, this was done, I had to test it ofcourse. The moment I ran `make LLVM=1`, I realized:

```c

it was long... ending with -
error: aborting due to 28 previous errors

Some errors have detailed explanations: E0405, E0412, E0432.

```
There were references to `ARef` and `AlwaysRefCounted` all over the place. So this wasn't just about moving code; it involved updating all the call sites too.

I started wondering - should I really send this as one massive patch? It didn‚Äôt seem ideal. So I dropped a comment on the issue asking whether I should split the moving and refactoring. The maintainers replied with a clear *yes*.

I also had to declare the new file in `sync.rs` in this way:
```c

diff --git a/rust/kernel/sync.rs b/rust/kernel/sync.rs
index 096cb78c8ec3e5..00f9b558a3ade1 100644

@@ -10,6 +10,7 @@ use crate::types::Opaque;

 pub mod lock;
```

#### Learning About git --base
So I sent the first patch, just the moving one. And that's when someone pointed out:

> "Add --base to your git format-patch command."

That was a neat trick I hadn‚Äôt used before. It helps indicate the base commit over which your patch is applied, so reviewers don‚Äôt face weird diffs or merge conflicts. Been using it ever since for every patch.

---

#### Iterations Begin...
In v2, I sent both patches - the moving one and the call-site updates. But there was one thing which I took care about i.e. I re-exported the reference to `sync/aref.rs` in `types.rs` so even if only the first patch was picked, it wouldn't create an issue.

```c
pub use crate::sync::aref::{ARef, AlwaysRefCounted};
```

Except... I messed up. Again.
Some extra lines sneaked into the new file. No clue how it happens every time with meü•∫ but hey, we learn from it. So I fixed it and sent v3.

That‚Äôs when maintainers pointed out something important:
> The call-site updates should be split subsystem-wise, so each maintainer can review  their relevant part and potentially give Acked-by.

They were kind enough to even give me an example to follow (you‚Äôll see it in the Email thread if you're curious).

I also learnt a new thing present in rust-linux. Rust follows strict styling. So as soon as you run `make rustfmtcheck`, it will list all the styling issues. But don't worry, you can simply run `make rustfmt` and it will fix everything for you! That's truly honestly. It also has the Clippy tool which I haven't explored yet, but will surely do it soon.

---

#### Interactive Rebase Is Magic üöÄ
Once I figured that out, I started digging through the tree to identify which subsystem each call-site belonged to and broke it down into separate patches.

That‚Äôs when I truly appreciated how powerful `git rebase -i` is. Being able to split, edit, squash, and reorder patches made everything feel more manageable. It went from one giant wall of change to a clean, modular patch series.

---

#### Confusion (and a Bit of a Gamble)
I hit a bit of a gray area when it came to the core kernel files.
Some of them had different maintainers here and there. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should split these out too, but honestly, the series was already long enough and splitting these would take it higher by an additional 10.

```c
rust/kernel/auxiliary.rs     |  2 +-
rust/kernel/cred.rs          |  6 +-----
rust/kernel/device.rs        | 10 +++-------
rust/kernel/devres.rs        |  3 +--
rust/kernel/dma.rs           |  2 +-
rust/kernel/opp.rs           | 13 +++++++------

rust/kernel/pid_namespace.rs |  5 +----
rust/kernel/platform.rs      |  2 +-
rust/kernel/task.rs          |  7 ++++---
```
If they ask me to separate them later, I‚Äôll do it. But for now, I decided to leave them grouped.

---

#### Still Waiting...
So yeah, that‚Äôs the story of this patch series. Definitely the most involved one I‚Äôve done yet.

The [first patch (the move)](https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/DBCLH4WXYTJL.FDZ9B39OO3TY@kernel.org/T/#mb67fbddcd894665d6ec6b0854e37930dedab468b) has already been accepted, which gave me a bit of peace of mind üòå

Now I‚Äôm just waiting on Acked-bys for the rest. Fingers crossed ü§û
Hopefully they‚Äôll all be upstreamed soon!

#### Update, as on 22nd July 2025

(PS: I might have referenced this blog in few others just beacuse its been going on for quite a while now, but yes, there has been a lot of learning through this and the maintainers have been really good throughout.)
