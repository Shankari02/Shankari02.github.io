If there's one thing I've learned from contributing to the Linux kernel, it's this:

#### The Bug That Came After the Patch

So I had sent in this patch to fix `strncpy()` in the `nconf` tool ([Commit link](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=1b92b18ec419cac4bb57e405ac1f571e0943a950)) to ensure null termination. It was reviewed, accepted, and applied. All was well... or so I thought.

Until a few days later, I saw this in my inbox:

[**[BUG linux-next] nconfig: uncleared lines of text on help screens**]  
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAK7LNAT54nvwYmTy20Ep8U2kr4thn68yYWXi9R-d3Yx3iXs=Bg@mail.gmail.com/T/#)

At first glance, I panicked a bit. A *bug report* on a patch I had sent in. Not ideal. But after taking a step back, I carefully went through the report and realized the issue was most likely from this line I had changed:

```
- tmp[len] = '\0';
+ tmp[sizeof(tmp) - 1] = '\0';
```
This was supposed to fix a strncpy() issue, but it ended up truncating help messages in nconfig. And yep, the maintainer confirmed that the regression was introduced by my change.

#### Fixing What I Broke
So the next step was clear: send a fix.
Here's the patch that I sent:
ðŸ”— https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kbuild/934992e6-9a2d-426d-8bd7-895062966214@infradead.org/T/#

At the time of writing this, I havenâ€™t received a formal review yet, but the original bug reporter tested it and confirmed that the fix works. Thatâ€™s definitely a relief.

As per the Linux kernel process, itâ€™s good practice to wait two weeks before following up if thereâ€™s no response. So Iâ€™ll wait. Patience is part of the workflow.

#### What I Learned
- Even careful patches can go wrong.
- Linux kernel is a community. Whether you're new or experienced, you're welcomed, encouraged, and mentored.
- Mistakes are part of learning. What matters is how quickly and responsibly you respond.
- Maintainers are human. Theyâ€™re busy and yet still take time to respond and guide you. Always be respectful of their time.

Also... I still mess up the small things:
- Forgetting to update changelogs (v2, v3 etc.)
- Missing links to previous reports
- Minor git send-email mistakes
But that's okay. These things are fixable, and the community understands that.

#### What's Next?
Iâ€™m currently working on patches in the selftests and BPF areas, so youâ€™ll definitely see more blogs soon.

I also want to write about:
- Patches I sent but werenâ€™t accepted because thereâ€™s a lot to learn from why something gets rejected.
- Tips on git send-email, and eventually, b4 - which Iâ€™m planning to explore more.

And of course, updates on the Rust kernel patches, which are still under review. Itâ€™s a big series and Iâ€™m really looking forward to seeing it go in.

Until then...
If youâ€™re new to kernel development: start small, test thoroughly, and don't be afraid to fix what breaks. Youâ€™re not alone in this.
